# Developing a Language-Agnostic LLM-Powered Code Vulnerability Scanner

**Important Note:** This ```research``` was generated with ChatGPT Deep Research to help me automate research and ideas.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT series have shown remarkable ability to understand and generate code, opening new possibilities for automated security code reviews. In traditional static analysis, tools rely on predefined rules and often struggle with high false positives or language-specific limitations. By contrast, an LLM-based vulnerability scanner can leverage the model’s knowledge of common weakness patterns across languages. For example, an experiment using GPT-3 to scan a vulnerable codebase found 213 potential issues, compared to 99 found by a top commercial scanner​
github.com
. This report explores best practices to build a language-agnostic code vulnerability scanner using an LLM (such as GPT-4 Turbo) that can: traverse a repository’s directories, identify the programming language of each source file, analyze code for security weaknesses (e.g. injections, insecure deserialization, use of vulnerable APIs), and report potential vulnerabilities with file names and line numbers. We also discuss effective model choices, prompt engineering techniques for reliable detection, multi-language support, examples of LLM-based scanning in practice, and how to integrate the scanner into a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated issue reporting.

## Selecting an OpenAI Model for Vulnerability Scanning

Choosing the right LLM is critical for effective code vulnerability detection. GPT-4 (and its variants) is currently the most capable model in OpenAI’s lineup for complex reasoning and code understanding. Studies have shown that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 in identifying security flaws​

. In one evaluation on C++, Java, and Python code, an improved GPT-4 model achieved an F1 vulnerability detection score of ~0.90 with optimal prompting, far higher than GPT-3.5 Turbo​

you. Similarly, a research prototype (IRIS) that combined static analysis with GPT-4 detected 55 of 120 known vulnerabilities in real-world Java projects, versus only 27 detected by CodeQL alone​
arxiv.org
. These results indicate that GPT-4’s deeper understanding can catch more issues, including logical vulnerabilities that purely rule-based scanners might miss.

When implementing a scanner, GPT-4 Turbo (8k context) or the 32k context version are ideal, as they can handle larger code files in a single prompt. The larger context window allows scanning hundreds of lines or multiple files at once if needed. GPT-3.5 Turbo (4k context) is a lower-cost alternative, but it may miss subtler issues and has lower overall detection rates​

. Early experiments with GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) demonstrated the feasibility of LLM scanning, but also highlighted limitations like context size and occasional oversights​
github.com
. For instance, GPT-3 had to analyze files individually due to context limits, meaning cross-file vulnerabilities requiring whole-repository reasoning could be missed​
github.com
. Newer models like GPT-4 alleviate some of these issues with more tokens and better accuracy. In summary, GPT-4 Turbo is the recommended model for a language-agnostic scanner given its superior code comprehension and vulnerability detection performance, whereas GPT-3.5 may be used for preliminary scans or budget-conscious scenarios (acknowledging a drop in recall/precision).

## Prompt Engineering for Reliable Vulnerability Detection

Crafting effective prompts is essential to guide the LLM to produce accurate and comprehensive vulnerability reports. Unlike a human code review, the AI needs clear instruction on what to look for and how to format its findings. Best practices for prompt engineering include:

- Role and Task Specification: Explicitly instruct the model that it is acting as a security auditor. For example, a system message could say “You are a cybersecurity expert reviewing code for vulnerabilities.” This primes the LLM to adopt a security-focused mindset.

- Request Specifics and Context: Provide the code (or a relevant excerpt) and ask the model to identify any security vulnerabilities, ideally with the type of flaw, an explanation, and where it occurs. It helps to mention the programming language or framework if known, so the LLM can apply language-specific security knowledge. For instance: “Analyze the following Python code for security vulnerabilities such as injection, insecure deserialization, use of unsafe functions, etc. Provide a list of any vulnerabilities found, including the category and an explanation, and reference the affected line numbers.” Including a brief list of vulnerability categories in the prompt can remind the model to check for those issues, but the prompt should also encourage “any other potential security issues” to not miss less common flaws.

- Chain-of-Thought and Step-by-Step Prompts: Encouraging the LLM to reason step-by-step can improve detection reliability. Research has shown that step-by-step prompting yields better results than a direct query​
    mdpi.com
    . For example, the prompt might say: “Think through the code step by step and consider how an attacker might exploit it. First, identify potentially dangerous operations or inputs, then determine if proper validation or safeguards are in place.” This can lead GPT-4 to systematically evaluate each part of the code for weaknesses, rather than jumping to a quick (and possibly superficial) answer. One study found that a step-by-step prompt led to the highest improvement in detection F1 score for GPT-4 variants​
    mdpi.com
    .

- Output Formatting: Ask the model to output findings in a structured format that can be easily parsed or included in reports. For example, you can request a bullet list where each item includes the vulnerability type, description, and location. If the code snippet was provided with line numbers (more on that in the next section), the model can reference those. For instance: “1. SQL Injection – Unsanitized user input query is concatenated into an SQL query (line 42).” Structuring the output makes it easier to compile a final vulnerability list across files.

- Few-Shot Examples: In some cases, providing a small demonstration in the prompt can help. You might include a short code snippet and an example analysis (as a guide) before asking the model to analyze the real target code. This is a form of few-shot prompting that can calibrate the model’s responses. However, note that adding examples consumes part of the token context; with GPT-4’s advanced capabilities, a clear instruction is often sufficient.

It’s important to iterate and refine prompts based on results. If you find the model is missing certain types of issues, you can adjust the wording or add additional hints in the prompt. Conversely, if the model is hallucinating nonexistent problems, you may need to constrain the prompt to focus on factual code analysis. Studies have noted that prompt wording can affect false positive rates​
blog.wohin.me
. In practice, a concise but direct prompt that defines the task and expected output format tends to work well for code scanning. Below is an example prompt for a single file analysis:

```
You are a security expert. Analyze the following JavaScript code for any security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, command injection, insecure deserialization, use of vulnerable libraries, etc.). Provide a list of each potential vulnerability, with a brief explanation and the line number(s) where it occurs. If the code is safe, state that no issues were found.

```javascript
// File: utils/db.js
${code_contents_with_line_numbers}
```


In the above prompt, note that the code is labeled with the file path and enclosed in a code block with syntax hint (JavaScript) – this helps the LLM recognize the language. Including line numbers in the code (which can be pre-generated by the scanning script) allows the model to reference specific locations. The model’s answer to such a prompt might look like: 

- *SQL Injection*: In function `runQuery` at **line 27**, user input `query` is directly concatenated into the SQL string without sanitation. This could allow an attacker to inject SQL commands.  
- *No Output Encoding*: The function `renderComments` at **line 52** inserts user-provided comment text into HTML without encoding, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.  

Each finding includes the nature of the vulnerability and where in the file it occurs. Good prompt design will encourage the LLM to be thorough and clear in this manner.

## Language Detection and Multi-Language Code Parsing  
To support scanning of a **multi-language repository**, the scanner needs to identify the language of each source file and possibly adjust analysis accordingly. The simplest approach is to use the file’s extension and known conventions. Most programming languages can be inferred from their file extensions (`.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript, `.java` for Java, etc.), which is both fast and reliable in the common case&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. For example, a file ending in `.py` can confidently be classified as Python. In cases where the extension is ambiguous or missing (such as a script with no extension or a header file `.h` that could be C or C++), a bit of content analysis is useful. Checking the **shebang line** (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python3`) can reveal the language of scripts without extensions&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. For `.h` headers or other shared extensions, examining keywords in the content (like `#include` vs `import`, or class definitions syntax) can disambiguate C vs C++ vs Objective-C&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. Tools like GitHub’s Linguist or libraries (e.g., **LanguageSniffer** or **guesslang**) implement these heuristics – for instance, LanguageSniffer performs “deep content inspection” for edge cases such as distinguishing C/C++ headers by looking for language-specific keywords&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. In our scanner, after traversing the repository directory, we can use a mapping of extensions to languages and supplement with content-based checks to tag each file with a language. This language info can then be passed into the LLM prompt (as shown in the example prompt above) to help the model apply relevant vulnerability knowledge (for example, alert for SQL injection in PHP files, or command injection in shell scripts, etc.).

Another aspect of multi-language support is handling language-specific **code parsing or structuring** before sending it to the LLM. Generally, LLMs do not require an abstract syntax tree or formal parse – they can work directly on raw code text. However, preparing the code snippet can improve results. It’s wise to **remove or skip large autogenerated files or dependencies** (like `node_modules/`, minified JS, or compiled artifacts) – these are unlikely to contain vulnerabilities in your own code and would waste token space. Focus on first-party source files. If a file is extremely large (approaching or exceeding the model’s context limit), you have a few options: 

- **Chunking:** Split the file into logical chunks (e.g., by function or class, or ~200-300 line blocks) and analyze each chunk separately with the LLM. This ensures each prompt stays under the token limit. The scanner can then aggregate the findings for that file. When chunking, include context in each chunk if possible (e.g., overlap a few lines or mention in the prompt that “this is part X of the file” to provide continuity). Keep in mind that chunking might cause the model to miss vulnerabilities that span chunk boundaries (such as a tainted variable defined in one chunk used in another). It’s a trade-off necessitated by context size. 

- **Summarization for Cross-File Context:** For vulnerabilities that involve multiple files (like misuse of an API in one file and insecure configuration in another), a basic scanner might miss these since it analyzes files independently. A more advanced approach is to use the LLM to summarize important behaviors in each file (or identify entry points) and then do a secondary analysis of those summaries to find multi-file issues. This is a complex enhancement and somewhat experimental. In practice, many vulnerabilities can be found within a single file’s context, especially injections or misuse of functions, as evidenced by GPT-based scanners mostly succeeding with per-file analysis&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.

During parsing, it’s also helpful to **annotate code with line numbers** as mentioned. A simple way is to prepend each line with its number as a comment or within the text (the model will treat it as part of the code context). For instance: `1: def vulnerable_function(user_input):` and so on. The model can then mention “line 1” in its output. If this isn’t done, the scanner can still attempt to map the model’s output back to line numbers by searching for the reported code snippet in the file – but providing line numbers upfront is more straightforward. 

Finally, ensure the scanner recognizes **multiple programming languages** and uses appropriate prompts for each. You might maintain a dictionary of language-specific prompt tweaks or vulnerability focus points. For example, for C/C++ code you might remind the model to check for memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free), while for Python you’d emphasize insecure deserialization or use of `exec/eval`, and for web languages like JavaScript/TS consider XSS, CSRF, etc. The core scanning logic remains the same; just the contextual hints can be adjusted per language to get the best coverage of vulnerabilities.

## Examples of LLM-Based Vulnerability Scanning  
Recent experiments and projects have demonstrated the feasibility of LLM-driven code scanning, offering insights into effective techniques:

- **GPT-3 Experimental Scanner (Chris Koch, 2023):** In a public experiment, a security researcher used OpenAI’s GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) to scan a repository of intentionally vulnerable code. The results were surprisingly strong – GPT-3 identified more than **200 vulnerabilities** across 129 files, whereas a commercial static analysis tool found only 99&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. GPT-3’s findings included issues like format string exploits, log injection, and buffer mismanagement, and manual review suggested a low false positive rate (only 4 out of 60 sampled reports were false alarms)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. This showcased the raw power of LLMs to catch security issues across different languages (the test repo contained C, C#, Python, etc., each with known flaws). However, the experiment also noted limitations: due to the 4000-token context limit, the scanner had to analyze each file separately, meaning vulnerabilities that span multiple files or require global context could be missed&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. Indeed, GPT-3 could sometimes infer cross-file issues if they involved common libraries (likely because the model “knows” typical usage of those libraries)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}, but it’s not foolproof. This experiment used relatively straightforward prompts and still achieved good coverage, indicating that even without complex prompt tuning, LLMs have a strong baseline knowledge of common vulnerabilities. (It’s worth noting that GPT-4, being more advanced, would presumably perform even better in such a scenario.) On the flip side, external analyses of this experiment pointed out that GPT-based analysis can produce **false positives** that a less experienced user might take as correct. For example, GPT-3 flagged an “Unvalidated user input could lead to buffer overflow” in a C snippet where the issue was not truly a buffer overflow, showing that the model’s explanation can sometimes be imprecise&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. This underlines the importance of having security experts review the AI’s findings or using the AI in an assistive role rather than an unquestionable authority.

- **IRIS – Neuro-Symbolic Analysis (2024):** Academic researchers developed IRIS, a system that combines GPT-4 with static analysis for **whole-repository** vulnerability reasoning&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. In their approach, GPT-4 was prompted to infer *taint flow specifications* and perform contextual reasoning that traditional static analyzers lack&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. The LLM would, for instance, guess which functions are sources, sinks, or sanitizers of untrusted data, and then static analysis checks those guesses against the code. This marriage of AI intuition with formal analysis proved effective – IRIS detected more than double the vulnerabilities CodeQL did on a Java benchmark, and even discovered some new 0-day issues&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. The takeaway for our purposes is that LLMs can augment static analysis by providing insights (e.g. likely data flows or security rules) that would normally require human expertise to encode. While IRIS is a complex solution, it suggests that even a simpler LLM scanner could benefit from some static analysis help – for example, one could use a lightweight static tool to identify suspicious patterns or inputs, and then have the LLM analyze those in detail. Conversely, the LLM could flag things that static analysis misses, such as insecure logic, and those could be double-checked.  

- **Prompt Engineering Research:** Multiple studies have focused on how to prompt LLMs for better vulnerability detection. *Zhang et al.* (2023) explored **prompt-enhanced vulnerability detection** for Java and C/C++ code, finding that the way the query is phrased can significantly impact ChatGPT’s detection capability&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. *David et al.* (2023) optimized prompts for smart contract security analysis and noted that while GPT-4 could catch many issues, it also had a **high false positive rate** in their tests, indicating the prompt needs to be carefully calibrated&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. One effective strategy from these studies is to break the task into sub-tasks in the prompt (e.g., first list all inputs and sensitive operations, then analyze each for potential misuse) – essentially guiding the model’s reasoning. Another strategy is using an ensemble of prompts: for example, **GPTLens** (a framework for smart contracts) runs multiple auditor agents with different prompts to generate varied vulnerability reports, then uses a critic agent (another GPT-4 instance) to merge and rank the findings&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. This two-stage approach (generation + discrimination) reduced random errors and improved accuracy by having the model “double-check” its own work. While running multiple LLM calls per file may be too slow or costly for a CI workflow, these ideas could inspire future enhancements – for instance, running a quick scan with one prompt and then re-prompting the model on the same code to verify or elaborate on the found issues, thereby filtering out spurious results.  

:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27} *Examples of advanced LLM-based vulnerability scanning frameworks. **GPTLens** uses multiple GPT-4 auditors to produce independent security reports on a smart contract, then a critic agent merges and ranks the results (reducing errors). **LLM4Vuln** evaluates different prompt schemes (raw code vs. with hints, etc.) to improve the model’s reasoning on vulnerabilities. **GPTScan** combines GPT-based pattern matching with static analysis confirmation to detect smart contract logic flaws&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. These approaches illustrate how prompt design and hybrid techniques can boost accuracy in specific domains.*  

In summary, real-world usage and research confirm that LLMs are capable of performing meaningful vulnerability analysis across languages. They excel especially at finding well-known vulnerability patterns (like injection flaws, hardcoded secrets, misuse of crypto, etc.) thanks to the vast training knowledge they possess. However, they are not infallible – they might miss subtle bugs that require understanding of the entire system or runtime behavior, and they might occasionally raise issues that aren’t actually problems. The best results often come from using LLMs as a complement to traditional methods: letting them cast a wide net to find likely issues, then validating those findings with additional tools or expert review.

## CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions  
Integrating the LLM-powered scanner into a continuous integration pipeline ensures that security checks are automated and continuously applied. **GitHub Actions** is a convenient platform to achieve this, allowing you to run the scanner on every code push or on a schedule. Automating security scans in CI helps catch vulnerabilities early and consistently, without relying on manual reviews&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. Here’s how you can set up the integration:

- **Workflow Trigger:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow (YAML file in `.github/workflows/`) for the security scan. Common triggers are `push` (to certain branches, e.g. main) and pull request events, so that every new code change is scanned. You might also schedule a nightly or weekly scan using the `schedule:` trigger (cron syntax)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}, which can catch issues in dormant parts of the repo or in dependencies over time. For example, a workflow could run the scan daily at midnight and whenever a PR is opened, ensuring both regular monitoring and immediate feedback on new changes.

- **Setup and Dependencies:** In the workflow’s job steps, first use `actions/checkout@v3` (or v4) to pull the repository code. If your scanner is a script (e.g., a Python script that calls the OpenAI API), you may need to set up the runtime environment (for instance, install the OpenAI Python SDK, etc.). Also, add a step to load the OpenAI API key – usually by storing it as a repository secret and then exporting it as an environment variable for the scan script. **Security note:** GitHub Actions allows storing secrets which won’t be printed in logs; ensure the API key is kept secure.

- **Running the Scanner:** Next, run the scanning script across the codebase. This could be a single step like: `- name: Run LLM Vulnerability Scanner\n  run: python3 scan_repo.py` (assuming `scan_repo.py` encapsulates the directory traversal, language detection, and calls to the OpenAI API). The script should output the results, and ideally, produce an artifact or file with the list of vulnerabilities found (for use in the next step). You might have the script generate a Markdown report or a JSON output. Alternatively, the scanning logic could be packaged as a custom Action, but using a straightforward script is often easier for a bespoke tool.

- **Conditional Issue Creation:** After the scan, if any vulnerabilities were detected, the workflow should automatically create a GitHub Issue to alert developers. This can be done with a pre-built action or via a simple API call. One convenient option is to use an Action from the marketplace like **“Create Issue”** (e.g. `dacbd/create-issue-action@main`), which takes the GitHub token and issue content as input and opens a new issue&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. You can configure the step to only run when the scan found problems (using the `if:` condition in the workflow). For example: 

  ```yaml
  - name: Create Issue for Vulnerabilities
    uses: dacbd/create-issue-action@main
    if: steps.scan.outputs.vuln_count && steps.scan.outputs.vuln_count != '0'
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      title: "Security Scan Report - Vulnerabilities Detected"
      body: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.report }}
      labels: "security,automated-scan"

In this snippet, we assume the scan script set output variables like vuln_count and report (the latter could be the markdown text of the findings). The action will create a new issue in the repo with the given title, body, and labels. It’s also possible to mention specific team members or assign the issue to a security team. If you prefer not to use a marketplace action, you could use the GitHub CLI (gh issue create ...) or a direct HTTP POST to GitHub’s API from a script to create an issue. The result is an issue that clearly summarizes the potential vulnerabilities for developers to review.

Example of an automatically created GitHub Issue from a security scan (in this case, an npm audit CI job). The CI workflow opened an issue titled “npm audit found vulnerabilities” and included a summary table of the findings​
github.com
. Similarly, our LLM-based scanner could create issues listing each file, vulnerability type, and line number discovered, giving developers immediate visibility into security problems.

    Failing the Build (Optional): Depending on your policy, you might choose to fail the CI pipeline when vulnerabilities are found (preventing merges on pull requests). This can be done by having the scanner script exit with a non-zero status if issues are detected, or by using the fail output of the issue-creation action. Failing the build makes the problem very visible, but it could also block all merges until addressed. Some teams prefer to not fail the build, and instead just file the issue and perhaps leave a comment on the PR, so that it doesn’t bottleneck development if the findings need triage. A balanced approach is to fail only for high-severity issues or certain categories, and just warn for others.

    Continuous Improvement: Over time, monitor the scanner’s performance in CI. Check the issues it creates – are there false positives or noise? If so, refine the prompt or add post-processing filters in the script (for example, ignore a known safe function usage that the model keeps flagging). Also, update the prompt or vulnerability knowledge as new security best practices emerge. Because the scanner uses an LLM via API, you can iteratively improve it without changing the underlying model – prompt engineering updates or adding a small rule-based filter can go a long way to tuning the results to your codebase’s needs.

    Rate Limits and Cost: One practical consideration in CI is the time and cost of using the OpenAI API. Scanning a large repository file-by-file with GPT-4 can be time-consuming and potentially costly (since API usage is pay-per-token). Mitigate this by scanning only the diff for pull requests (i.e., new or modified code, rather than the whole repo) – this speeds up feedback on incremental changes. For scheduled full scans, you might use GPT-3.5 for a quick pass and GPT-4 for thorough analysis on critical parts. Also ensure your Action is configured with a reasonable timeout and that you handle API errors (the script should catch exceptions from the OpenAI API calls to avoid failing the entire workflow unpredictably). Caching results for unchanged files can also save time: if code hasn’t changed since the last run, skip re-scanning it (unless the model’s knowledge might change, which in a static code scenario it won’t, so caching is fine).

By integrating into GitHub Actions, the LLM scanner becomes a proactive tool in your DevSecOps pipeline. Every code push can be checked, and any issues discovered are immediately logged for the team. Developers will see a security issue just like any other CI failure or issue, and can address it on the spot. This automation can significantly reduce the window of time that vulnerabilities live in the codebase. It’s akin to having an AI security expert review each pull request in real-time. Just remember to treat the AI’s findings as assistive – they are there to highlight suspicious code, which then warrants a closer look or testing. With a well-tuned prompt and GPT-4’s strong capabilities, the scanner can reliably catch many common vulnerabilities and provide useful context that speeds up remediation.

## Conclusion

Building a language-agnostic source code vulnerability scanner with an LLM combines the strengths of AI code understanding with the practicality of automation. By carefully selecting a powerful model (GPT-4 Turbo) and guiding it with well-crafted prompts, we can scan through diverse codebases (Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, and more) to uncover security flaws that might otherwise go unnoticed. Key technical ingredients like robust language detection, handling large files, and structuring the AI’s output allow the scanner to function across a variety of file types and sizes. We’ve seen from examples that LLMs are capable of catching a wide range of issues – from injections to logic bugs – often rivaling traditional scanners in coverage​

.

Integrating the scanner into a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow turns it into a continuous guardrail for your repository. Every commit or pull request triggers an automated audit, and any potential vulnerabilities are surfaced immediately as GitHub issues or CI alerts for developers to triage. This encourages a security-by-design culture, where code is scrutinized for safety as it’s written, not months later during a penetration test. Moreover, because the scanner is language-agnostic and driven by the LLM’s knowledge, it can be extended to new languages or frameworks with minimal changes – a new file type is just another prompt context for the model, which likely already knows the common pitfalls of that technology.

In implementing such a scanner, it’s advisable to start small and simple: perhaps run the LLM on a few critical files or modules to see the quality of results, then gradually scale up. Pay attention to the output, adjust prompts, and build trust in the tool’s findings. Over time, the LLM scanner can become an invaluable automated code reviewer, flagging security issues early and complementing your other static analysis or dependency scanning tools. With the rapid improvements in LLM capabilities, we can expect these AI-based scanners to become even more accurate and integral to secure software development workflows. By following the best practices outlined – from model selection and prompt engineering to CI integration – you can develop a reliable, multi-language vulnerability scanning system powered by cutting-edge AI. The result is a more secure codebase and a development process that proactively defends against bugs and vulnerabilities from the moment code is written.
